# SCAI Website

SCAI is a responsive landing page that highlights an AI-powered screen intelligence platform. The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no build tools required—so you can deploy it on any static host in seconds.

## Features

- Hero section with call-to-action buttons
- Product walkthrough sections with imagery
- FAQ accordion interaction powered by `script.js`
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Fully responsive layout defined in `styles.css`

## Project Structure

```
scai-website/
├── index.html    # Main page markup
├── styles.css    # Global styles, layouts, animations
└── script.js     # Smooth scrolling + FAQ toggles
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cmk31311/ScreenAI.git
   cd ScreenAI
   ```
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder via any static server:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

## Downloads

Distribution files (`.zip` and `.dmg` installers) are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Cmk31311/ScreenAI/releases). These files are too large for the main repository but can be downloaded from the releases page.

## Deployment

Because this is a static site, you can deploy it using GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static hosting provider. Just point the host to the repository root.
